# Production Stability Plan - 13,000 Concurrent Users

## Critical Issues to Address
- Session timeout after 2-5 minutes
- App crashes when second user logs in
- Need to scale from current state to 13,000 concurrent users

## 1. Authentication & Session Management
### Immediate Fixes
- [ ] Fix session refresh logic in `useSession` hook
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for auth requests
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup of stale sessions
- [ ] Add session heartbeat mechanism

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Update `AuthStateManager` to handle multiple sessions
- [ ] Implement session recovery on network errors
- [ ] Add connection state monitoring
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for auth failures

## 2. Database Optimization
### Connection Management
- [ ] Implement PgBouncer for connection pooling
- [ ] Set optimal pool size (recommend 100-200 for 13k users)
- [ ] Configure statement timeout (30 seconds max)
- [ ] Add connection retry logic

### Query Optimization
- [ ] Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Implement query result caching with Redis
- [ ] Use database views for complex queries
- [ ] Batch similar queries where possible

## 3. Supabase Configuration
### Upgrade Requirements
- [ ] Upgrade to Pro plan minimum (Team plan recommended)
- [ ] Configure connection pooler mode to "Transaction"
- [ ] Increase max connections to 500+
- [ ] Enable read replicas for load distribution

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Configure custom rate limits for auth endpoints
- [ ] Implement client-side request throttling
- [ ] Add request queuing for non-critical operations

## 4. Frontend Optimization
### State Management
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Add connection state recovery
- [ ] Implement offline mode with local storage

### Performance
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Add pagination for data-heavy components
- [ ] Lazy load non-critical components
- [ ] Implement request deduplication

## 5. Caching Strategy
### Implementation
- [ ] Add Redis for session caching
- [ ] Implement CDN for static assets
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add browser-side caching with IndexedDB

### Cache Layers
1. Browser cache (1-5 minutes)
2. CDN cache (5-60 minutes)
3. Redis cache (5-30 minutes)
4. Database query cache

## 6. Real-time Optimization
### Current Issues
- [ ] Disable real-time for non-critical features
- [ ] Implement presence channels efficiently
- [ ] Add connection pooling for WebSocket
- [ ] Implement fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

## 7. Infrastructure Scaling
### Load Balancing
- [ ] Deploy behind CloudFlare or similar CDN
- [ ] Implement geographic distribution
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling policies

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add custom metrics for key operations
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical thresholds

## 8. Testing Plan
### Load Testing
- [ ] Use k6 or JMeter for load testing
- [ ] Test with 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 13000 users
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks at each level
- [ ] Test failover scenarios

### Stress Points to Test
- [ ] Simultaneous login of 100+ users
- [ ] Sustained load for 1+ hours
- [ ] Database connection exhaustion
- [ ] Memory usage under load

## 9. Deployment Strategy
### Phased Rollout
1. Fix critical bugs (1-2 days)
2. Implement caching (2-3 days)
3. Database optimization (2-3 days)
4. Load testing (2-3 days)
5. Production deployment with monitoring

## 10. Emergency Procedures
### Failsafe Mechanisms
- [ ] Circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Graceful degradation plan
- [ ] Database connection limits
- [ ] Request queue overflow handling

## Cost Estimates
- Supabase Team Plan: $599/month
- Redis hosting: $100-200/month
- CDN: $50-100/month
- Monitoring tools: $100-200/month
- **Total: ~$1000-1500/month**

## Priority Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. Fix session timeout issue
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Add proper error handling
4. Upgrade Supabase plan
5. Add basic monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Zero timeouts under normal load
- < 2 second page load time
- 99.9% uptime
- Support 13,000 concurrent users
- < 100ms database query time (p95)
